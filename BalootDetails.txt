CardsInterface.java 
	# This interface has the following methods:
	1. public int cardNum
	2. public int cardType <- there has to be only four types!

CardsClass.java   -- to store the 4-type cards and their attributes for the
ShuffleCards.java -- to randomize the cards
GameType.java     -- Either Hekem or Sun?
players.java      -- to follow the gameplay with the players
scores.java       -- to store the scores and set the rules for winning


Note: Cards must not duplicate! the eight cards for each player should be randomized out of a KNOWN set of 32 cards.

Now each player gets 8 random cards.
